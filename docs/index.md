# Tensor BNN
This package contains code which can be used to create full Bayesian Neural Networks using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling as proposed by Radford Neal in his thesis "Bayesian Learning for Neural Networks" along with some added features. The package is written in python and uses the packages `Tensorflow` and `Tensorflow-Probability` as the framework for the implementation. 

For instructions on how to setup this package, [click here](Setup.md).

If you would like an explanation of how to use the code, [click here](usage.md).
